# Hi! I'm Kaleb Hedges.

CompSci/CyberSec Grad at Swinburne Uni.

Love building small terminal applications.

Main exposure to programming at has been through self-learning prior to uni (dabbled in arcane languages like *Common Lisp* and *Ada 2012*) and uni itself which has mainly comprised of foundational *C++*, *C#*, *JavaScript*, and *PHP*.

## ðŸŒ± My Current Goals:
- Develop my understanding of data structures and design patterns.
- Developing my skills in *C++*.
- Attempting to enter the workforce.

## ðŸ”­ The Languages I have the most experience with (Sorted by exposure):
- _C++_
- _C#_
- _Python_
- _PHP_

## ðŸ’» My current plans for language learning:
- **Primary**:
  - _C++_
- **Secondary**:
  - _C#_: Getting stuff done.
  - _Python_ : Great for getting small quick scripts going
  - _Clojure_ : I enjoyed playing with Clojure. Lisp languages are great and having the JVM on top was fun.
  - _PowerShell 7_ : A terminal/cmd language to allow me to better utilise my systems.
  - _Zig_: Even though it is still in an unstable stage it is quickly becoming my favourite systems lang.
