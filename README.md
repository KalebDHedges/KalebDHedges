# Hi! I'm Kaleb Hedges.

Recent CompSci/CyberSec Grad at Swinburne Uni.

Love building small terminal applications (e.g. Generators for TTRPG's).

Main exposure to programming at has been through self-learning prior to uni (dabbled in arcane languages like *Common Lisp* and *Ada 2012*) and uni itself which has mainly comprised of foundational *C++*, *C#*, *JavaScript*, and *PHP*.

Overall I am working on developing my developer skills:
- My main weak point is mathematics. I understand the basics probably up to a Math Methods standard but after that I drop off pretty quick.
- Dont care for frameworks (would rather have solid programming foundations, and then use frameworks to help with productivity).

## ðŸŒ± My Current Goals:
- Develop my understanding of data structures and design patterns.
- Developing my skills in *C/C++*, *C#*, *Zig*, and *.NET*.
- Attempting to enter the workforce.

## ðŸ”­ The Languages I have the most experience with (Sorted by exposure):
- _C++_
- _C#_
- _Python_
- _PHP_

## ðŸ’» My current plans for language learning:
- **Primary**:
  - _C#_: Getting stuff done.
  - _C++_ : Systems programming / primary language.
  - _Python_ : Great for getting small quick scripts going
- **Secondary**:
  - _Clojure_ : I enjoyed playing with Clojure. Lisp languages are great and having the JVM on top was fun.
  - _PowerShell 7_ : A terminal/cmd language to allow me to better utilise my systems.
  - _Zig_: Even though it is still in an unstable stage it is quickly becoming my favourite systems lang.
