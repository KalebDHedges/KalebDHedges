# Hi! I'm Kaleb Hedges.

I'm have just completed my bachelor of Computer Science, majoring in Cybersecurity, at Swinburne University.
I love building small terminal applications for my own personal enjoyment (e.g. Generators for TTRPG's), and learning new programming languages.
My main exposure to programming at large has been through self-learning prior to university (where I dabbled in arcane languages like *Common Lisp* and *Ada 2012*, as well as a little game development in *C++*) and then the university itself which has mainly comprised of elementary *C++*, *C#*, *JavaScript*, and *PHP*.

Overall my developer skills are currently quite lacking:
- I am working on improving them but there are some areas that are taking longer than others (Mathematics).
- I dont wish to rely on frameworks (I wish to have a solid programming foundation, upon which the frameworks can improve my productivity and workflow).

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- A small repo containing most of the Data Structures from the MIT Press Algorithms textbook.
  - I wish to do this in all four of my primary languages. 

## ðŸŒ± My Current Goals:
- Develop my understanding of data structures and design patterns.
- Developing my skills in *C/C++*, *C#*, *Python*, and *.NET*.
- Attempting to enter the workforce.

## ðŸ”­ The Languages I have the most experience with (Sorted by exposure):
- _C++_
- _C#_
- _Python_
- _JavaScript_
- _PHP_

## ðŸ’» My current plans for language learning:
- **Primary**:
  - **.NET**:
    - _C#_: Getting stuff done.
    - _F#_: Functional programming.
  - **Web Dev**:
    - _JavaScript_ : Cant avoid it.
    - _PHP_ : I enjoyed using it at Uni.
  - **Others**:
    - _C++_ : Systems programming / primary language.
- **Secondary**:
  - **Just for Fun**:
    - _Odin_ : I have enjoyed dabbling with Odin so far will be fun to see it grow.
    - _Zig_ : Same as Odin I enjoyed dabbling with it and can see potential in it.
    - _Clojure_ : I enjoyed playing with Clojure. Lisp languages are great and having the JVM on top was fun.
    - _PowerShell 7_ : A terminal/cmd language to allow me to better utilise my systems.
